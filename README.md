# Swift Design Patterns

This is a repository using Swift's design patterns and architectural designs.

I aim to centralize this in a single repository to be able to have easy access to these codes in the future, and also to help other people to study these designs.

The repository is divided into 4 parts:
- Architectures - Common software architectures, like MVC, MVVM, Viper, and other architecture studies;
- UIKit - Design patterns specific to UIKit;
- SwiftUI - Design patterns specific to SwiftUI;
- Common - Design patterns that can be used anywhere
